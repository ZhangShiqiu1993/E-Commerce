# My E-Commerce Platform
During my senior year, I was thinking about building my own project. I believe a good senior project should show my skills I learnt in the past four yearsï¼Œbut I failed.<br>
I realized that all these web technology is meant to solve a certain problem in a certain field. That means the using of technology is dependent on the business operation in real world. <br>
Here I began to create a shopping scenario. I am going to try to build a E-Commerce platform based on Rails 5.0.0.1. <br>
It probably would be my last web project in the following two years, since as a graduate student there are some new challenges coming to me.
